## Install Guide

### Cloning The Repository
Prerequisites: [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and a terminal emulator of your choice.

This command will clone the repository into your current working directory under the HandControl folder. I like cloning projects into a generic "Repos" directory. In general clone it into a directory where you'll be able to quickly remove the code from your machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/Mathieu-Poirier/HandControl
```
Change directory into HandControl.
```
cd HandControl
```
### Packages
```
pip install -r packages.txt
```
### Running The Client
Change directory into the client folder.
```
cd client
```
Run the client script
```
python .\client_async.py
```
To exit the client press the "q" key on your keyboard
